*What's new/different in System# compared to "_insert your SLDL here_"?*

  * Unlike most other SLDLs (system-level design languages), System# is based on C# and the .NET framework.

  * System# is not just restricted to simulation - it is a combined simulation/synthesis framework, featuring the generation of synthesizable VHDL from models. It is not only an embedded domain-specific language - it is also a tool.

  * Unlike most other synthesis tools, System# is open source.

  * To our best knowledge, we present the first open source tool which features generation of synthesizable VHDL from C#.

*What about [http://sourceforge.net/projects/esyssim/ ESys.NET]?*
  
  * ESys.NET is also a system-level modeling and simulation environment. It is currently restricted to simulation and does not feature code generation. System# is not related to this project in any way and did not derive any sources from it. System# is a completely unrelated, independent project.
